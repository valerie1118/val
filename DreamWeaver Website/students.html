                <p>The Entertainments Officer is responsible for organising and co-ordinating the social events for the student body.

The social side is hugely important for student life, and the Entertainments Officer is responsible for organising such events as Freshersâ€™ week, Rag week and many other regular socials throughout the year.</p>

                <p>I think that's enough about my background, my job is to make sure that you succeed both academically and personally. Time in college is the best time of your life, you will meet a lot of people that will become your friends for life. At some stage you will be stressing out and might overlook important bits and pieces and that's when we come in.

I'm here to represent your views and oversee the swift operation of the Students' Union. I'll represent our students at the Academic Council, Finance committee, Governing Body and many more. Role of the Education officer is to provide information and assist students with their academic problems and grievances related to their courses. 

You will see me on campus doing some crazy stuff so don't hesitate to say hi and join me on my adventures.</p>

                <p>As your Welfare Officer, my job is to look out for you. That means giving you advise and guiding you in the direction of services that help with financial assistance, health (both physical and mental), disability, LGBTQ+ issues, accommodation, health, safety, sexual health and reproduction and an array of other topics.

I sit on several boards and committees to ensure that your student experience is the primary focus at all times. Some of these committees include Diversity, Equality & Inclusions Committee, Health and Well-being and others!

I work with the team to ensure that class reps are elected and that we have monthly meetings to help us work out what issues needs to be flagged for attention, what I've been doing and what I plan to do. This helps me represent ITB students both locally on campus and nationally to the Union of Students in Ireland (USI).

I operate on an open door policy, so pop in for a chat any time you need to and I'll be happy to help in whatever way I can. You can see what hours I'm available from the roster inside the Students' Union office!

Finally, my advice to those who are new coming into ITB, is to join a society or club, get involved with events across the year and avail of all the services that are there for you!
