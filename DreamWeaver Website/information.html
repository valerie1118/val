                    The institute of Technology began in 1999.  The cement on the floor wasnâ€™t even dry yet. The people had to walk round the building a certain way. The most activity in ITB took place in the LINK building and A block. The A block was the first building built on campus. There was a 75 million euro investment at the time.

                    <q>1999-2006</q>
                    <br><br>
                   ITB offered, Electronics, computing, business, business technology, and Language. Since then there has been a. major improvement and there have been more courses added.
					From 1999-2006, the ITB logo was designed by president of ITB. 
                   Because the Internet was only starting, Yahoo was the biggest search engine. But Councillors and CAO handbooks were all still being used. There have been many ministers here on campus and all contributied to building the campus. This has been a massive success. 

There was big competitions in Navan and we fought hard to have an institute of technology in Blanchardstown. 
In 2004 the big building project was done. In 2009, the CDM launched- and set up a bebo page, the idea was to say if you applied to course please join the bebo page, this was a chance to interact with lectures and students. Since then information communicating through channels eg: snapchat, Instagram, twitter and facebook, Social Media have been used.
