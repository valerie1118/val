                    <p> The greater Blanchardstown area is located approximately 10 kilometres north-west of Dublin City Centre within the South Western Portion of County Fingal and on the borders of Counties Meath and Kildare. The area has experienced a period of unprecedented economic growth over the last decade and is now the industrial and commercial hub for Fingal with large concentrations of retail, pharmaceutical, IT, distribution and service companies.

The Blanchardstown shopping centre is one of the largest within Ireland and has impressive retail outlets, restaurants, cinema, theatre and other leisure facilities including the Dra√≠ocht Arts Centre and a public library.

ITB first opened its doors to students in 1999 and now caters for almost 3,500 students. In addition, to the economic infrastructure surrounding the Institute the area is served by a number of amenities including the National Aquatic Centre, which is unique in Ireland, a major hospital and a wide variety of recreational venues including the Phoenix Park.

 

A number of Dublin Bus routes serve the Blanchardstown area. From City Centre to Blanchardstown routes 38 , 38A and 70 operate. (Under the Network Direct Project Routes 38, 38a, 38b, 38c have been amalgamated in to 38 & 38a w.e.f. 31st Oct 2010). Route 76 serves those travelling from Tallaght, Clondalkin and Balrothery to the Blanchardstown Area.Local services include 220,236,37,238, and 270. (These link the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre with the surrounding area). Route 40D serves those travelling from from Dorset Street, Glasnevin and the Finglas area. </p>
